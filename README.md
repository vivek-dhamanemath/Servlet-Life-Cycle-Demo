# ServletLifecycle Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the lifecycle of a Java Servlet. A Servlet is a Java programming language class used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. The lifecycle of a Servlet is managed by the servlet container, which is responsible for loading, initializing, and managing the servlet's execution.

## Servlet Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a servlet consists of the following phases:

1. **Loading and Instantiation**: The servlet container loads the servlet class and creates an instance of the servlet.

2. **Initialization**: The servlet container initializes the servlet by calling the `init()` method. This method is called only once during the lifecycle of the servlet and is used to perform any initialization tasks, such as setting up resources.

3. **Request Handling**: The servlet container calls the `service()` method to handle each request. The `service()` method determines the type of request (GET, POST, etc.) and dispatches it to the appropriate method (`doGet()`, `doPost()`, etc.).

4. **Destruction**: The servlet container calls the `destroy()` method to take the servlet out of service. This method is called only once at the end of the servlet's lifecycle and is used to perform any cleanup tasks, such as releasing resources.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
/ServletLifecycle
|-- src
|   |-- main
|       |-- java
|           |-- com
|               |-- example
|                   |-- MyServlet.java
|-- web
|   |-- WEB-INF
|       |-- web.xml
|-- README.md
```

- **MyServlet.java**: This file contains the implementation of the servlet, including the `init()`, `service()`, `doGet()`, `doPost()`, and `destroy()` methods.
- **web.xml**: This file is the deployment descriptor for the servlet, which defines the servlet and its mapping.

## Running the Project

To run the project, deploy it to a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat. The servlet container will manage the lifecycle of the servlet as described above.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic understanding of the servlet lifecycle and how to implement a servlet in Java. By following the servlet lifecycle, you can ensure that your servlet is properly initialized, handles requests efficiently, and is cleaned up when no longer needed.
